# Futuristic_Airbnb

This Repository is created to to analyze data to find a better Accommodation based on customer satisfaction and to improve the Airbnb business based on certain factors in Berlin.


Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and more travelers decide to use Airbnb as their primary accommodation provider. Since its beginning in 2008, Airbnb has seen an enormous growth, with the number of rentals listed on its website growing exponentially each year. In Germany, no city is more popular than Berlin. That implies that Berlin is one of the hottest markets for Airbnb in Europe, with over 22,552 listings as of November 2018.Here we will be using Python with some packages like Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze data to find a better Accommodation based on customer satisfaction and to improve the Airbnb business based on certain factors in Berlin.
